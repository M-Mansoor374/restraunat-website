# 🎬 Splash & Login Flow - Every Time App Opens

## Overview
The app has been configured to **always show the splash screen and login page** every time someone opens or refreshes the application.

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### On Every App Load:
1. 🎬 **Splash Screen appears** (fullscreen, beautiful animation)
2. ⏱️ **Waits 3 seconds** (with fade-out starting at 2.5s)
3. 🔐 **Login Page appears** (smooth fade-in)
4. ✅ **User logs in** (authenticated, can use the app)

### On App Close/Refresh:
5. 🚪 **User closes tab/window** or refreshes
6. 🗑️ **Authentication cleared automatically**
7. 🔁 **Cycle repeats** from step 1

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Initial State
```javascript
// Always start as not authenticated
const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState(false);
const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
```

### 2. Clear on App Load
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Clear any previous authentication when app loads
  localStorage.removeItem('restaurantAuth');
}, []);
```

### 3. Clear on Window Close
```javascript
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', () => {
  // Clear authentication when window closes/refreshes
  localStorage.removeItem('restaurantAuth');
});
```

### 4. Splash Screen Timer
```javascript
// Show splash for 3 seconds
setTimeout(() => setShowSplash(false), 3000);
```

## ✅ What This Means

### For Users:
- ✅ Always see the beautiful splash screen
- ✅ Must log in every time they open the app
- ✅ Fresh, secure experience each visit
- ✅ No persistent login sessions

### For Security:
- ✅ No authentication persists between sessions
- ✅ Users must authenticate each time
- ✅ Better for shared devices
- ✅ Prevents unauthorized access

### For Branding:
- ✅ Splash screen shows your logo every time
- ✅ Consistent brand experience
- ✅ Professional app feel
- ✅ Always makes a great first impression

## 🎯 Behavior Examples

### Scenario 1: First Visit
```
1. User opens app
2. Splash screen (3s)
3. Login page
4. User logs in with email/password
5. Access to main app
```

### Scenario 2: Refresh Page
```
1. User hits refresh (F5) or Ctrl+R
2. Authentication cleared
3. Splash screen (3s)
4. Login page
5. Must log in again
```

### Scenario 3: Close & Reopen
```
1. User closes tab/browser
2. Authentication cleared automatically
3. User reopens app later
4. Splash screen (3s)
5. Login page
6. Must log in again
```

### Scenario 4: Multiple Tabs
```
Each tab is independent:
- Tab 1: Opens → Splash → Login → Main App
- Tab 2: Opens → Splash → Login → Main App
- Closing Tab 1 doesn't affect Tab 2
- But both require fresh login on reopen
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication Lifecycle

### During a Session:
```
✅ User is authenticated (can navigate the app)
✅ User data stored in state
✅ Navigation works normally
✅ All app features accessible
```

### Between Sessions:
```
🗑️ Authentication cleared from localStorage
🗑️ User state reset to null
🔒 No persistent session
🔁 Fresh start on next open
```

## 🎨 Visual Experience

### Every App Open Shows:

**1. Splash Screen (3 seconds)**
- Green gradient background
- Restaurant logo (animated)
- "Fine Dining. Redefined." tagline
- Loading dots animation
- Smooth fade-out

**2. Login Page**
- Smooth fade-in from splash
- Login/Signup toggle
- Email and password fields
- Welcome message
- Submit button

**3. Main App (After Login)**
- Header with user info
- Home, Menu, About, Contact pages
- Bottom navigation
- Cart functionality
- Logout option

---

## 💡 Why This Approach?

### Advantages:
1. **Consistent Experience**: Every user sees splash & login
2. **Security**: No persistent sessions to exploit
3. **Branding**: Logo shows every time (brand recognition)
4. **Fresh Start**: Clean state on every load
5. **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and maintain

### Considerations:
1. **Convenience**: Users must log in each time
2. **Quick Access**: No "remember me" option
3. **Session Length**: Only lasts while app is open

---

## 🛠️ Customization Options

### If You Want to Change This Behavior:

#### Option A: Keep Login for X Minutes
```javascript
// Save login with expiration time
const authData = {
  isAuthenticated: true,
  user: userData,
  expiresAt: Date.now() + (30 * 60 * 1000) // 30 minutes
};
localStorage.setItem('restaurantAuth', JSON.stringify(authData));
```

#### Option B: Remember Me Checkbox
```javascript
// Only clear if "remember me" was not checked
if (!user.rememberMe) {
  localStorage.removeItem('restaurantAuth');
}
```

#### Option C: Skip Splash for Returning Users
```javascript
// Show splash only on first visit
const hasVisited = localStorage.getItem('hasVisited');
if (!hasVisited) {
  // Show splash
  localStorage.setItem('hasVisited', 'true');
}
```
